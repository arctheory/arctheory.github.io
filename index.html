              The global 2D Chromatography market size is expected to grow from
              USD 33.4 million in 2020 to USD 48.5 million by 2026 at a CAGR of
              6.4%.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has increased the adoption levels of
              2D chromatography in various applications. Many researchers are
              aggressively using the concept of 2D chromatography to understand
              the gene structure of Sars-CoV-2 and to develop preventive
              measures. Considering the fact aforementioned, the global 2D
              Chromatography market is forecasted to register better growth
              statistics during the forecast period.
            </p>
            <p>
              The growth of this market is driven largely by factors such as
              pollution reduction programs, R&D investment by pharma companies,
              government support, and the growing petrol industry. Y-O-Y growth
              in the number of research activities happening across the world is
              expected to encourage the growth of the market.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, the scarcity of human resources who handle the
              2D chromatography operations is predicted to hamper the growth
              rate of the market during the forecast period.

              Virtual data rooms are majorly cloud-based platforms for sharing
              of critical documents among multiple stakeholders in a secured and
              controlled environment. These platforms are often used during
              mergers & acquisitions (M&A) processes to accelerate the due
              diligence tasks. The key stakeholders include business brokers,
              government contractors, financial advisors, real estate firms,
              private equity firms, and venture capitalists. According to the
              industry experts, virtual data rooms have been successful in
              reducing the M&A processing time approximately by four times than
              traditional data rooms.

            <p>
              The prominent regions of the world, North America, Europe, and
              Asia Pacific have been consistent in terms of number of M&A deals
              across sectors. M&A and partnerships are key strategies adopted by
              investors and big companies to generate more revenue and innovate
              on their product/service offerings. Carrying out M&A transaction
              through traditional methods often takes more than one month of
              time while virtual data room software platforms reduces this
              processing time by 4 times. The key capability of virtual data
              room software to allow multiple stakeholders efficiently and
              securely collaborate with each other during the M&A process makes
              it a necessary tool for enterprises and investment firms.
            </p>

            <h4 class="heading-h4">Cloud Technology for Virtual Data Rooms</h4>
            <p>
              Cloud computing is the key enabler for virtual data room. It
              allows the stakeholders involved in an M&A process to coordinate
              with each other from any place at any time. Due to the
              flexibility, scalability, and anytime-anywhere access features of
              the cloud, most of the virtual data room vendors offer their
              products through cloud deployment models.

              The countries covered in North America are the US and Canada. The
              region is the largest contributor in the global virtual data room
              market. From 2014 to 2019, the region has recorded number of M&A
              deals in the range of 14 thousand to 19 thousand every year. The
              highest number of M&A deals acts as a major driving factor for the
              virtual data room market in the North American region.
            </p>
            <p>
              In North America, the US occupied significant share of virtual
              data room market, because of the increasing adoption of virtual
              data room through diverse governments and companies. The rising
              demand for easy and secure strategies for the storage of essential
              information and the increasing need for transparent and efficient
              data sharing alternatives are fueling the market growth.
              Furthermore, the developing fundraising, rising range of mergers
              and acquisitions, and joint ventures with some of the
              distinguished gamers have fueled the market throughout the region.
